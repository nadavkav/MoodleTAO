Test Harness for TEO SSO Auth Plugin
------------------------------------

This test harness is more of a test environment.
It is written as a set of modperl2 handlers so:
apt-get install libapache2-mod-perl2

The basic function of it is to give:

* a service to mimic login
* a service to mimic logout
* handler to insert an SM_USER header
emulating  what CA Federation Manager will do.

The config is as follows:

    perlModule MyApache::FixupInputHTTPHeaders
    perlInputFilterHandler MyApache::FixupInputHTTPHeaders

    perlModule MyApache::Logout
    <Location /logout>
       SetHandler perl-script
       PerlResponseHandler MyApache::Logout
    </Location>

    perlModule MyApache::Login
    <Location /login>
       SetHandler perl-script
       PerlResponseHandler MyApache::Login
    </Location>


This corresponds to auth module config in Moodle for 
TEOSSO:

TEO Signin URL: https://seagull.local.net/login
        URL for site to redirect to when a User does not have a valid session
        eg. https://federation.intel.com/federation . This will have the
        target querystring parameter appended to it eg: https://federation.intel.com?target=http://teachonline.intel.com/auth/teosso/.
Log out from CA Federation Manager: X
        Check to have the module log out from CA Federation Manager when user
        log out from Moodle
TEO Sign Out URL: https://seagull.local.net/logout
       URL for site to redirect to when a User is to be completely logged out 
       eg. https://federation.intel.com/federation . This will have the RESUMEPATH
       querystring parameter appended to it which is always wwwroot of the 
       current Moodle.
Do not show username: X
       Check to have Moodle not show the username for users logging in by TEO SSO
HTTP Header name passed from CA FM: SM_USER
       Name of the HTTP Header that CA federation Manager uses to pass the User
       attribute declartions of a logged in user.

The perl modules need to be found in the Perl library search path - for simplicity
sake this can be copied into place and Apache restarted:
 sudo cp -r lib/MyApache   /usr/local/lib/site_perl/
 sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
