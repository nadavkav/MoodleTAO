    Elements before making the assignment available to students. This is done by<br />
    clicking on the assignment in the learning path, if no elements are present you will be asked<br />
    to add them. You can change the number of elements using the Edit Assignment screen,<br />
    the elements themselves can be amended from the &quot;Managing Assessment&quot; screen.';
