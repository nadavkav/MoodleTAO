<h1>Add a TAO Resource catalog entry</h1>

<p>Resources are content: information the teacher wants to bring into the 
course.  These can be prepared files uploaded to the course 
server; pages edited directly in Moodle; or external web pages
made to appear part of this course.
</p>

<p>TAO Resources are course independent, and are created in advance before being attached to a Course.</p>

<p>Resources are either URLs, or a locally uploaded file.  Specify your resource, along with the appropriate metadata, to add it to the searchable index.</p>
